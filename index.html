      <h1> Hack Club </h1>
      <p>When we say "hack", we're referring to the "life hack" type of hacking. Simply put, hacking is creative problem solving - and it often includes code. Hack Club will teach you to code and use coding skills to solve problems, not to crack into your bank account. Members of this club build web based projects and share them with one another.</p>
      <p>Join to learn to build websites similar to this.</p>
      <p>Club meets every club Friday from 2:40pm to 4:00pm</p>
